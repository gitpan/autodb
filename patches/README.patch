These instructions are reletive to the Class::AutoDB installation directory:
# get the Data-Dumper-2.121 distribution (you will need to patch the Data::Dumper source code)
cpan > get Data::Dumper
cp -r patches Data-Dumper-2.121 directory (usually ~/.cpan/build/Data-Dumper-2.121)
cd Data-Dumper-2.121 directory
cp Dumper.pm.patch Dumper.xs.patch <Data-Dumper-2.121 dir>
cp dd_freeze_thaw.t <Data-Dumper-2.121 dir>/t (dd_freeze_thaw.t tests the patches functionality)
patch Dumper.pm < Dumper.pm.patch
patch Dumper.xs < Dumper.xs.patch
# then build Data::Dumper as usual:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
# and build Class::AutoDB in the same manner
