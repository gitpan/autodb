A patch file (see patches directory in this distribution) has been created for Data::Dumper (Data-Dumper-2.121)
in order to allow for objects that do not implement a Data::Dumper::Toaster method 

  ( from the Data::Dumper docs: 
    Data::Dumper will emit a method call for any objects that are to be dumped using the syntax bless(DATA, CLASS)->METHOD() )

to co-exist with those who do. Without this patch, AutoDB objects that refer to non-AutoDB objects will freeze correctly but cannot be
thawed ("toasted"). Storage of AutoDB objects alone should be ok even without the patch.

The patch file should be applied ideally before running tests, but one can always patch and re-run the test suite.

This patch has been submitted to perl-5-porters and to Gurusamy Sarathy (Data::Dumper's author) for inclusion in the next version of
Data::Dumper.
