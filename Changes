0.06  Mon Aug 16 14:24:43 PDT 2004
	- major refactor of persistence handling. store() method added to store objects explicitly (implicit 
	storage still occurs when an object is destroyed. Implicitly destroyed objects will not overwrite 
	explicitly destroyed ones). Mosts tests have been re-written and new ones have been added to test
	this storage handling.

	- Added warning to Serialize that prompts users when their data source might be wrong (evil and silent bug)
	- added SQL limit capability to AutoDB, users can now pass a _limit_ => n, where n=max number of rows to fetch, in find args
0.1   Wed Jan  4 15:05:53 PST 2006
	- in Oid, added code to 'use' classes when object is fetched if not already 'used'. caution: this only works if people follow the Perl convention of placing module Foo in file Foo.pm.  Else, there's no easy way to translate a classname into a string that can be 'used'
	- in Oid, added overload for stringification and a few related op. stringify fetches object, so  serialized objects will work as expected when used as hash key
	- in Object, added overload declaration for objects after they've been fetched.  don't know why this is needed, but it didn't work without it
	- in Serialize, made -transients work
	- changed syntax of %AUTODB declaration to allow multiple collections to be specified with different keys. backwards compatible. affects code in Collection, Oid, Registration, Registry, RegistryVersion
