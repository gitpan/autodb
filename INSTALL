Class::AutoDB

*** ALPHA SOFTWARE ***
These classes are still in their alpha state. Use is encouraged, and bug reporting is strongly encouraged :)
Although there are a hefty amount of unit and integration tests that stand behind these classes, there use in 
real-world scenarios has been limited, so don't do anything all mission-critical-like.

DESCRIPTION
Class::AutoDB => creates registries in the database (currently, only mysql is supported) and transparently stores 
and updates collections in those registries.

INSTALLATION

  IMPORTANT: 
    mysql must be installed and configured before Class::AutoDB is installed.
    Most of the tests will skip unless you have default write access to the database (mysql -u root),
    or unless you alter the connection parameters in t/DBConnector.pm.
    Also, Class::AutoClass needs to be installed first (tests are depending on it, don't let them down!)

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
